#### Description

I use this repository to do a coding challenge, preferably thrice a week or more, in three languages which I use often for my projects; JavaScript, PHP and Python.

Each challenge will have its own directory with a QUESTION.md file and the three respective scripts files.

I will try to add unit tests for the functions.

If you see a better way to improve any of the solutions I will be posting here, please feel free to add a pull request.

Thank you!
